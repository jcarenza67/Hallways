### Research & Planning Log
#### Friday, 07/07/2023

* 9:23: downloading textures from unity asset store
* 9:45: to 10:43: trying to commit game files to github, but its more complex than I thought. researching how to do it.
* 11:30: lost half of my project prefabs, trying to restore them.
* 11:45: restored project!
* 1:15: versioning control research.
* 2:30: Making sure im carefully adding files to github.
* 3:52: Taking a bit to add all necessary files to github. Thankfully I have 2 days of environment I built last weekend.
* 4:14: Adding blood to the bathroom.
* 4:45: leaving computer on to finish huge push to repository.
* 8:00: adding more props to the scene.
* 8:54: figuring out how to code new person controller to interact with objects from a different asset.
* 9:42: reading documentation on how to use the new person controller.
* 10:04: decided to just go back to adding props to the scene. I'll figure out the new person controller in a couple of hours.
* 10:34: making blood in bathroom look more realistic. tell a story with the blood.
* 11:05: finding character model to add animations and upload into my game.
* 11:41: found a character model and working on blending it so I can put the right textures on it. Then going to mixamo to add animations.
* 12:16: downloading character and animations from mixamo.
* 1:14: downloaded character and am uploading it to Unity.
* 2:00: Character is imported with textures! Now I am going to set up trigger animations
* 2:30: researching triggers and colliders to make the character move when player crosses a certain point.
* 3:00: placed a box trigger in the spot with a boolean isTrigger set to true. Researching the asset documentation for interaction.
* 3:38: got the doors to kind of interact with the player. But the character has stopped moving. Researching why.
* 8:13: I figured out how to get the doors to move with new player controller in the documentation. Now I have to change some scripts.
* 8:45: Still working on getting doors and drawers to open with interaction. Setting them as dynamic objects and adding audio to them.
* 9:25: Having clashes with scripts. Going to set up the environment more and come back to this. Add more props and textures.
* 9:58: Switched back to old controller and am going to try and add certain animations to the character. Doors open and close with the player now!
